# AppleScripts

AppleScripts for controlling various actions in applications.  These can be 
exported as an Application or just run as AppleScripts.  
I used the scripts in global keyboard shortcuts in Keyboard Maestro.

More information on Keyboard Maestro can be found
[on their site](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).
